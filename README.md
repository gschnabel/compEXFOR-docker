Note: The company behind MongoDB recently changed their license to the
[Server Side Public License](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license)
which is controversial in the open-source community.
Therefore you may want to check out the
[exfor-couchdb-docker](https://github.com/gschnabel/exfor-couchdb-docker)
repository to setup the EXFOR library as a CouchDB database.
